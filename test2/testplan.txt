Test Plan:

The tests will be automated using the .sh file.
A group of individual tests for each module will be made.
These tests will cover:
1. Does the module report errors and whether it does it correctly
2. Does the module interact with different modules as intended
3. Does it behave correctly during edge cases and invalid inputs
4. Are the outputs of the module what is expected

All the test for every module will be specified in the .sh file and run every time by the programmer to ensure changes in one module do not have a negative affect in the different modules.
The output of each test states whether the test has been successful or not, and specify what was the error.
